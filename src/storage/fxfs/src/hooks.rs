//! Thread-safe filesystem test hooks.
//!
//! # Design Architecture & Invariants
//!
//! - **`Hooks<'a>` & `HooksHandle`**: `Hooks<'a>` is the exclusive mutator handle bound to lifetime
//!   `'a` (the test context). `HooksHandle` is shared via `Arc` by `FxFilesystem` options to invoke
//!   registered test callbacks (`on_*` methods) during transaction commits.
//!
//! - **Lifetime Safety**: Incoming hook closures bound to lifetime `'a` are transmuted to `'static`
//!   and stored inside `HooksInner`. `Hooks<'a>` holds the primary `Arc<HooksInner>`, while
//!   `HooksHandle` holds a `Weak<HooksInner>`.
//!
//! - **Cleanup & Synchronization**: When `Hooks<'a>` drops, it drops its `Arc<HooksInner>` and
//!   waits for a message on an `mpsc` channel. Active readers (`on_*` methods) temporarily upgrade
//!   the `Weak` reference to an `Arc`, ensuring `HooksInner` remains valid during callback
//!   execution. When all readers finish and `HooksInner` drops, `SendOnDrop` (the last field of
//!   `HooksInner`) drops after `HooksTable`, sending the completion signal to `detach()`.
